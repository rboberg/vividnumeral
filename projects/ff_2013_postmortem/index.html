			<h2>Nerd Level: 1</h2>

			<p>
			Before the 2013 Football season I wrote a couple pieces detailing a quantitative fantasy draft methodology. You can find the details <a href='../ff_rank'>here</a> , but, in short, I used player stat projections aggregated by <a href='http://www.fantasypros.com'>fantasypros.com</a> and some adjustments to compare players across positions to quantify each player's value. With the season in the rear-view mirror, I want to know whether it was worth the trouble.	
			</p>
			
			<p>
			I'm feeling pretty good about the model since all three of my fantasy teams were first or second this year. But that's a very small sample size and a ton of other factors that could effect that outcome (like luck). This article takes a more robust look at whether it was a waste of time.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			The punch line is that the expert estimate based draft ranks added between 4 and 7 points per game over just using ESPN's Average Draft Position to determine picks. That is statistically significant. I broke this article in to Nerd Levels: increasing degrees of method detail and quantitative complexity. So you can take my word that this method adds value, stop reading, and send me a congratulatory email or move on to Level 2.
